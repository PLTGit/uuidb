# uuidb
UUID based NoSQL document store in/for Perl, ideal for graph storage, JSON DBs, etc.
Usage is as simple as loading the library and configuring the object - no other
processes or servers required (unless your chosen back-end is a DB engine).

## Flexible
Store any kind of data you want, even mixing document types within the same datastore.

## Extensible
Simple plug-in architectures, callbacks, and configurations to modify, extend, or intercept nearly any operation.

## Work In Progress

Under active development, better documentation forthcoming.
